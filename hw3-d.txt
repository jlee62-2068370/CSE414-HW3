Overall I thought that being able to work with a
cloud hosted DBMS was amazing. No longer did I have to
create a database using the command line nor view/populate
tables using sqlite3. By having a cloud hosted DBMS,
it made it all the more convenient to create and store
databases for use. Additionally, connecting Azure to VSC
was extremely helpful and efficient when it came to
running SQL queries and viewing results. To that end, I
would most definitely reccomend working with a cloud hosted
DBMS, or some commercial DBMS, to coworkers over other students.
This is many because of the cost of many commercial DBMS
could be a lot for a student who is just trying it out, whereas
if it was a coworker, who specializes in data analytics or
something along those lines, it makes more sense since it
would be something for their career. Students could use local
DDMS for free, for example, sqlite3. Which is something light weight
and also free to use. Nonetheless, I would greatly like to show
my appreciation for CSE414 for allowing students to use Azure, it's
been a longtime dream of mine since it's always been
expensive for me.
